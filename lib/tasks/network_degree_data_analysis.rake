  # Task parameters:
  #
  # segments_file -
  # This file contains a list of segments by which the analysis will run.
  # For example, by departments or offices etc. (no matter what this segment represents, this
  # should aggregate employees by some logical group - we can define that a segment is people
  # with black hair - and the analysis will run by)
  #
  # data_file -
  # The data to analyze. This file should contain ext_id and name of employee AS COLUMNS 0,
  # respectively. Moreover, it should contain columns named by the network, and degree - names
  # should be the exact string which is given in the network, and degree params.
  #
  # network -
  # The network by which to analysze the data.
  #
  # network_value -
  # The value in the network column by which to make the first filter stage. Currently supports
  # only single value - but in the future should be given an interval of values
  #
  # degree -
  # The degree on which we make the analysis - currently takes the top values. How many values is
  # determined by group size - some percentage (defined in code), or minimum (defined in code)
  # if there are not enough.
  #
  # debug - whether to print out to console more elaborate debug messages
